                  <strong>Infrastructure Review</strong><br>
                  <p>56Bit starts the process by carrying out a review of the existing infrastructure in order to understand the client’s operations and demands of the infrastructure. 56Bit believe that the present is the ideal place to start when looking at the future.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Infrastructure audit</strong><br>
                  <p>An audit of the current infrastructure and systems is carried out in order to document and understand the configuration, level of usage, load and efficiency of the current setups. This information is crucial for ensuring stability and continuity at later stages of the project.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scoping</strong>
                  <p>Conducting scoping sessions with the client to understand what the desired company state is and what requirements will be placed on the resulting infrastructure. 56Bit wants to ensure that, while the present is understood, any designed architecture will take the client well into the future.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design options</strong>
                  <p>The wealth of information collected on the current systems and the desired client state are put together to draw up one or more options of how the architecture could be designed for the client to reach the desired state and how cloud services can be leveraged in this process. Different topologies are considered as well as the various components required such as AWS Services, Azure Services or other relevant Service components. These options are all studied in detail and the concepts are tested from various angles for suitability, scalability, cost efficiency and stability. Basing this exercise on a study of the current systems together with the desired client objectives gives peace of mind to the client that any solutions provided are addressing the real client’s business needs. Options are presented to and discussed with the client.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Future proofing</strong>
                  <p>Client discussion and further study into client projections leads to 56Bit carrying out an infrastructure forecasting exercise. This is important to understand the present and future demands on the infrastructure in order to ensure that actual load is understood at the start. Any infrastructure options being studied are tested against the forecasted loads to ensure that the design is as future-proof as possible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Perpetual Availability</strong>
                  <p>Designs are further enhanced to ensure that they are perpetually available. This process builds in resilience and redundancy into designs while also considering business continuity options and possibly also disaster recovery scenarios where appropriate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Security Posture Exercises</strong>
                  <p>Assessments of the current security aspects of a client’s infrastructure can be carried out and these can then be transposed and improved into the designed infrastructure.  Security needs to be tight enough to ensure that the client’s security objectives are reached while being flexible enough to allow the client to operate comfortably. 56Bit accompanies the client in walking this fine line.</p>

                  <p>In order to ensure that the client invests where the largest return is given, 56Bit is able to work with the client to provide prototypes of the different options. Prototypes are tested with the client in order to understand in practice which option will give the best results.</p>

                  <p>56Bit is with the client throughout all the steps of the cloud journey, from A to Z. Once scenarios have been studied, architecture options drawn up, prototypes done and an option chosen, the next stage in the journey is to implement it in a live environment. Different options can be considered, from a full cloud option to hybrid options being a mixture of cloud services and on-premise setups. In all instances, however, 56Bit employs skilled staff and industry best practice to deliver their advice and solutions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cloud-native infrastructures are all implemented through 56Bit’s custom infrastructure setup methods, whether they are traditional, cloud services, micro-services or serverless platforms. All options are implemented to ensure that there is a clear fit with the client’s business and technical requirements in order to deliver a solution that satisfies the client’s needs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In implementing solutions, 56Bit ensure that clients are protected against DDOS attacks. Many DDOS issues are preventable by default through out-of-the-box features up to level 4, i.e. the network layer. In addition, 56Bit can plug in tools like WAF (Web Application Firewall) and others in order to protect implementations from DDOS attacks at layer 7, i.e. the TCP layer. These protect against attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting amongst others.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>56Bit recognise that the most delicate part of a cloud project is the actual migration to the new infrastructure. A migration needs to ensure that the client continues to operate seamlessly and smoothly through the migration and that no information or functionality is lost at any point.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Plan</strong><br>
                  <p>Migration options need to be drawn up. These need to cater for the client's realities, the type of migration (cloud-to-cloud; on-prem-to-cloud) as well as any business constraints relating to the process. There are different migration options that can be considered from an online migration with no downtime (these tend to be the more common carried out by 56Bit) to ones with minimal downtime planned to a big-bang migration that may entail planned downtimes or planned reduced availability during the migration. These options are assessed and the best migration scenario is selected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dry Run</strong>
                  <p>Based on the considerations made in planning, the actual migration process is studied and a detailed plan is drawn up. This plan is dry-run on paper to ensure that all eventualities are catered for and all possible preparatory work is planned for and carried out.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Execute</strong>
                  <p>The final execution of a migration is usually an anti-climax. 56Bit are so accustomed to planning and considering all options that once the actual migration is carried out it usually goes so smoothly since all possible issues and anomalies would have already been catered for in the planning stages. The main decision to be taken in the execution stage then tends to be the actual time when the process should be carried out depending on the client peak hours.</p>

                  <strong>Prevent</strong><br>
                  <p>All infrastructure is operating in multiple dynamic environments that are ever changing. Client realities could change causing changing demands on the infrastructure; economic realities can change causing client’s customers to make different demands of the infrastructure; security issues can change causing changing demands on the infrastructure and the technical environment can change with the daily advances in technology. While 56Bit designed infrastructures would have pre-empted as much change as possible, no one has a crystal ball to know the future to its full detail. For this reason 56Bit employs preventive maintenance measures to ensure that the infrastructure is still operating within its intended parameters. These measures include preventive maintenance routines as well as regular patching of any patchable elements in the infrastructure in order to ensure that any issues are prevented from the outset.</p>
                </li>

                  <p>Despite all the preventive measures that can be taken to ensure that a system operates smoothly and perpetually, 56Bit also carries out monitoring of the infrastructure in order to immediately know if there is an issue or even if an issue is predicted in the future.
